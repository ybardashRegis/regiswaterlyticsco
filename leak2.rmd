# Purpose
- The purpose of this file is to explore the HB1051 data with emphasis on water leakage. The data can be found http://cowaterefficiency.com/unauthenticated_home with permission. Once in the portal, all report years (2013-2017) were selected as well as all water providers.
- Section 1.0 is clean up, section 2.10 is analysis.


# 1.0 Reading in Data
- The following files were used:
    + overview.csv
    + normalizing_03_population.csv   - was initially merged for population, but ultimately not used.
    + foundational_09_balance_data.csv
  
```{r}

#read in data
overview <- read.csv("EffDataPortal_Output_User690_20181112192716//overview/overview.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

normalizing_pop <- read.csv("EffDataPortal_Output_User690_20181112192716/normalizing/normalizing_03_population.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

foundational_09_balance_data <- read.csv("EffDataPortal_Output_User690_20181112192716/foundational/foundational_09_balance_data.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

head(overview, n=10)
head(normalizing_pop, n=10)
head(foundational_09_balance_data, n=10)
```


# 1.0 Merging Overview & Normalizing_Pop on ce_annual_ndx & Foundational_09 balance data (to get water provider town name)
- ce_annual_ndx represents the unique water provider that is unique for each provider per year of reporting (which means Denver will have as many ce_annual_ndx numbers as years reported)
- Overview & Normalizing are merged first on ce_annual_ndx, then merged with foundational_09_balance_data on the same variable
- Percentage of Water loss is calculated from the resulting file as calculated_lossS / distributed_watS
- There are about 46 towns where metered water is NA which results in a non-useable percLoss
- Lafayette for 2015, 2016 had no distributed water loss
```{r}
### ce_index is unique for water provider
### ce_annual_ndx is unique for year and provider
joined <- merge(overview, normalizing_pop, by="ce_annual_ndx", all=TRUE)

### remove columns
###
remove <- c("bndss_basin_index", "bndss_type_index", "provider_comments", "report_status", "bndss_id", "pop_served_source", "transient_pop_source", "remark")
joined <- joined[, !(names(joined) %in% remove)]
head(joined, n=10)

### Combine balance data/loss with overview (city & year)
balanceM <- merge(joined, foundational_09_balance_data, by="ce_annual_ndx", all=TRUE)
head(balanceM, n=10)


### calcuate sums of water useage by type (potable, non, etc) by city (indx #)
### calculate percent loss = calculated loss/ distributed wats 

balanceSum <-balanceM %>% group_by(ce_annual_ndx) %>% summarise(distributed_watS = round(sum(distributed_water, na.rm=TRUE), 2), metered_waterS=round(sum(metered_water),3),  calculated_lossS= round(sum(calculated_loss), 2) , percLoss = round(calculated_lossS/distributed_watS,2)) 


### add in descriptor columns
###
c <- c("ce_annual_ndx", "water_provider", "basin", "type", "report_year", "pop_served", "units" )
#colnames(balanceM)

balanceM_short <- balanceM[, (names(balanceM) %in% c)]
together <- merge(balanceSum, balanceM_short, by="ce_annual_ndx")
TotalLossYear <- together[!duplicated(together[,1]),]

# remove all water providers where metered_water is NA
TotalLossYear <- TotalLossYear[!is.na(TotalLossYear$metered_waterS), ]
head(TotalLossYear, n=10)
hist(TotalLossYear$percLoss)

# remove Lafayette 2015, 2016
TotalLossYear <- TotalLossYear[!TotalLossYear$distributed_watS ==0,]
```
- The following water providers may have errors in reporting because their metered water is much greater than their distributed water. These were removed from the visualizations below
    + Little Thompson - 2014-2017
    + Pueblo - 2013
    + Lafayette - 2013
    + Louisville - 2017
- 31 rows were removed, see excel chart for which water providers and years
